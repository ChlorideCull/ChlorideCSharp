#Contributing

Feel free to contribute fixes, new functions, etc. You only need to follow some basic guidelines.

* Follow the guidelines stated in the readme.
* Test your changes.
* Don't write essays in the commit fields, but quickly explain what you did.
* Code should resemble code - not pasta (does not apply to comments).
* Work under a separate branch, and send a pull request when you deem it stable.
* If the API for the library is listed as STABLE in LIBRARIES.md, make sure to
  bump the version number [appropriately](http://semver.org/).
